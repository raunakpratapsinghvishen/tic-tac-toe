Tic Tac Toe Game
**Overview**
Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun two-player game, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each player takes turns placing their symbol (either an "X" or an "O") in one of the grid's squares. The goal is to be the first player to align three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**How to Play**
Game Start: Open the game in a web browser. The game will start with an empty 3x3 grid. Player 1 uses "X", and Player 2 uses "O".

Turns: Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their symbol.

Winning the Game: The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins.

Draw: If all squares are filled without any player forming a line of three, the game ends in a draw.
